AtMega32 drivers that installed on Eta32:
This is my drivers based on the following KIT specs.
Eta32 kit is an AVR development board designed particularly for students, beginners and recently graduated engineers to provide easy developing of AVR microcontroller projects.
Eta32 supports ATMega32 MCU chip. 
Eta32 kit provides the most common primary devices and circuits, such as LCD, KEYPAD, serial interface, and more.
